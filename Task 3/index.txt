Task 3

In situation, where I am working on these 2 tasks and I face a family emergency. I will do the following things.

solution:
1. First of all, I will contact my manager and team immediately and make them aware about my situation.
2. Since Task 2 requires to be completed within 2 days and Task 1 is not having any fixed delivery date, 
I will talk about prioritizing delivery of task 2 before task 1 with my manager, team lead and concerned team mates.
3. After approval from my manager, I will contact with Manoj (Account Manager for Task 1) and explain him my
situation and tell him that it will take me more than 3 days from current date to deliver the task and also 
tell him about a high priority task which I am working whose delivery needs to be done in 2 days from now.
4. After this, I will contact with Ravi (AM of task 2) and inform him about my situation and then assure him that
the task will be delivered on due date but in worse scenario might get delayed by a day.
5. In all my talks with Acoount managers of both tasks, I will ensure that my manager is present or atleast aware
about the developments on this.
